# LESCO-recognizer

## Summary:

This project is an evolution of Juan Zamora's Doctoral dissertation: "Video-Based Costa Rican Sign Language Recognition for Emergency Situations" from Aspen University. The main idea is to create a recognition framework that is able to "understand" LESCO from videos and be able to translate each video into a set of keywords in spanish (or any language) for full video-2-text translation.

## Methodology: 

Design Science (DS) has been used as the main research methodology. DS provides a set of practices to translate an idea into a product leveraged into a set of iterations where every artifact is tested and evaluated for further iterations. Each iteration could be seen as an "Agile" iteration where ne wideas and hypothesis are tested.

## Itertations

- Iteration 1: translate LESCO videos into text by using similary measures
- Iteration 2: translate LESCO videos into text by using Deep Learning
- Iteration 3: evolution of Iteration 1 with other dimensional reduction algoritms.
